            <p>Hi, I’m Anton a passionate Graphic Designer with a wide variety of skills. In
                terms of my career, graphic design has always been my first choice.</p>
                
                <p>Due to financial constraints I had to pursue other options and my full-time
                graphic design had to be put on the back burner for a while.
                During this time, I obtained my N3, wiremen, and Red Seal, and I started my
                own Electrical company.</p>

                <p>At present I am committed to continue my career as a graphic designer. My
                love for designing and creating are still number one. Admiration and client
                satisfaction for your creation, is something I pride myself in.
                And if given the opportunity I will be an asset to your team</p>

            <p>IEComms's</p>
            <p>Iecomms was a design house that specialized in all things graphic & marketing related.</p>
                <p>I designed a vast array of projects here. designs included adverts for the State Theatre. The
                logo design was also done here and I used Illustrator or Corel for these elements. Banners
                had to be done with InDesign and editing of photos for the banners would go with photoshop.</p>

            <p>Zinplex</p>
            <p>Zinplex was a medical company that specialized in supplements & vitamins. My task there
                was to design product packaging and labels for their products. When they had expos i had to
                design all the relevant material such as pull up banners, flags, and content for the booths. I also
                had to design adverts for the newspapers and magazine’s.</p>

            <p>Max My Ride Magazine</p>
            <p>A printable car magazine where I had to do most of the designing.</p>
            <p>I designed mostly the covers for the magazine. For the cover of the magazine, I had to
                manipulate, retouch or edit photos to work with font selections and main highlights of the
                magazine itself. For the inside of the magazine, I had to design the layout and all the other
                graphical elements like the adverts and features with mostly photoshop and InDesign. For all
                other vector elements, I had to use illustrator</p>
